# MyBlog 

Welcome to MyBlog a simple blog application that allows you to create and delete plog posts. This project was my first introduction to React. In this project I learned the fundamentals of react including components, useState hooks, props, react router, and more. I also learned the basics of storing my data localy with JSON Server. This was a fun beginner project to introduce me to the basics, I look forward to building on this knowledge in future projects. See images below to see code highlights and the blog.

This is the create blog post page where you can post whatever you want to say. In this application there are two predecided users to choose from so you cant create your own account. In future projects I will learn and add authorization to allow signup and sign in features.
